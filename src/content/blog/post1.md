Just first setting up the blog site.  It is very barebones; a lighlty modified blog template provided by the Astro team.

Astro seems like a very friendly way to develop static websites such as this blog.
I can actually modify html code directly without the cumbersomeness of React.
I've dealt with React and it seems to be way to overkill for a simple text blog.

I wanted to at least set this up so I can push blog posts regularly (as best as I can).  Blog will change overtime as I learn more on css.
CSS is one of those things I dread, but I have some success understading it with the help of TailwindCSS utility classes.

My primary focus nowadays is improving upon and refining my knowledge in game engine development.
Thank's to TheCherno's Game Engine series, I've learned quite a bit on what exactly goes into a game enigine.
I'll talk a bit more about it in the coming days.

Signing off,
